YouTube to New Track - DEBUG VERSION INSTALLER

IMPORTANT: This is a DIAGNOSTIC VERSION

This installer will:
• REPLACE your existing YouTube_to_NewTrack.lua script with a DEBUG version
• The debug version shows detailed error messages and logs every step
• Use this to troubleshoot problems with the script not working

What the debug version does:
• Shows popup messages if something fails (instead of silently failing)
• Logs detailed information to REAPER Console
• Shows exactly where the script stops working
• Displays file paths being checked for yt-dlp and ffmpeg
• Tests file permissions and tool detection

After installation:
1. Copy a YouTube URL to clipboard
2. Run the script in REAPER (same way as before)
3. Watch for any ERROR POPUP MESSAGES
4. Check REAPER Console (Extensions → ReaScript → Show Console)
5. Send back screenshots + console text to help diagnose the issue

Requirements (same as regular version):
• REAPER 7.0+
• SWS Extension
• yt-dlp and ffmpeg (can be installed automatically)

This debug version will help identify exactly why the script isn't working on your system.
