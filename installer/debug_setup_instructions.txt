YouTube to New Track - DEBUG VERSION - Setup Instructions

=== DEBUG VERSION INSTALLED ===

Your original YouTube_to_NewTrack.lua script has been REPLACED with a debug version.

HOW TO USE FOR TROUBLESHOOTING:

1. COPY A URL
   • Copy a YouTube or SoundCloud URL to your clipboard first

2. RUN THE DEBUG SCRIPT
   • Open REAPER
   • Go to: Actions → Show Action List
   • Find "YouTube_to_NewTrack" (same name as before)
   • Double-click to run it

3. WATCH FOR MESSAGES
   • The debug version will show POPUP ERROR MESSAGES if something fails
   • Don't dismiss them quickly - read what they say!
   • Take screenshots of any error messages

4. CHECK THE CONSOLE LOG
   • In REAPER: Extensions → ReaScript → Show Console
   • The debug script logs every step it takes
   • Copy ALL the text from the console

5. SEND BACK THE INFORMATION
   Send back:
   • Screenshots of any error popup messages
   • Complete text from the REAPER Console
   • This will help identify exactly where the script is failing

=== WHAT THE DEBUG VERSION CHECKS ===

The debug script will test and report on:
• SWS Extension detection
• Clipboard content reading
• URL pattern matching (YouTube/SoundCloud)
• yt-dlp.exe location and accessibility
• ffmpeg.exe location and accessibility
• File write permissions in temp directory
• VBScript creation and execution
• Download progress monitoring

If ANY of these steps fail, you'll see exactly which one and why.

=== TO RESTORE ORIGINAL VERSION ===

Run the original installer again to replace the debug version with the normal script.
